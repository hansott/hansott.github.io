      <description>Last night I was experimenting with Silex and I needed a register/login form. Silex comes with a SecurityServiceProvider which gives you the power of the symfony/security component. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to programmatically login the user after registration. So here&amp;rsquo;s my solution:
The registration controller:
&amp;lt;?php use Silex\Application; use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request; final class RegistrationController { // ... public function register(Request $request, Application $app) { $email = $request-&amp;gt;get(&amp;#39;email&amp;#39;); $password = $request-&amp;gt;get(&amp;#39;password&amp;#39;); // validation logic.</description>

      <description>Introducing React Refetch  We obviously needed to standardize on a way to load data, but we werenâ€™t really happy with any of our existing methods. Loading data into state made components smarter and more mutable than they needed to be, and these problems only became worse with more data sources. We liked the general idea of unidirectional flow and division of responsibility that the Flux architecture introduced, but it also brought a lot of boilerplate and complexity with it.</description>

      <description>To be able to work with your databases in PHPStorm, you should define them as data sources. Data sources provide the basis for SQL coding assistance and code validation.
 Laravel Homestead is an official, pre-packaged Vagrant box that provides you a wonderful development environment without requiring you to install PHP, HHVM, a web server, and any other server software on your local machine.
 Select View | Tool Windows | Database, click on the + button and choose Data Source | MySQL:</description>
