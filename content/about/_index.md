![Hans Ott](/images/hansott.jpg)

I'm a web & mobile developer with a strong interest in domain-driven design and functional programming. I'm deeply in love with clean code and I'll do anything to motivate other developers to leave the campground cleaner than they found it. You can find me on GitHub where I actively contribute to open source. I'm currently working at [Clarabridge](https://cxsocial.clarabridge.com) as software engineer.
