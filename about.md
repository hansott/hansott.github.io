![Hans Ott](/images/hansott.jpg)

I'm a web & mobile developer with a strong interest in PHP, JavaScript, open-source software and domain-driven design. I'm deeply in love with clean code and I'll do anything to motivate other developers to leave the campground cleaner than they found it. You can find me on GitHub where I actively contribute to open source. I'm currently working at [Engagor](http://www.engagor.com/).

I also maintain a few packages myself:

* [Pinterest PHP](https://github.com/hansott/pinterest-php): A simple PHP wrapper for the Pinterest API.
* [Lastify](https://github.com/hansott/lastify): PHP library that syncs your music between Last.fm, Spotify, etc.
* [generator-php-package](https://github.com/hansott/generator-php-package): A yeoman generator that generates a skeleton repository for your PHP package.
* [Spotify Backupper](https://github.com/hansott/spotify-backupper): Creates backups of your Spotify library
